# Shutdown HAL Configuration
# This file is executed when LinuxCNC shuts down
# Use it to ensure clean shutdown of hardware

# The LDCN driver automatically disables all axes on shutdown
# No additional commands needed for basic shutdown

# Example: Set outputs to safe state
# (When digital outputs are implemented)
